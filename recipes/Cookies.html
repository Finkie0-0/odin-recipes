    <h3>Discription</h3>
    <p>
       These delicious Chocolate cookies taste like brownies. They're crisp
       on the outside, soft and fudgy in the inside. 
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups margarine, softened</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 cup of chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C(350 degrees F).
        </li>
        <li>
            Cream sugar and margarine in a large bowl until light and fluffy.
            Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in vanilla.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl.
            Add to the creamed mixture and mix until just blended. Stir in
            walnuts. Drop spoonfuls of dough 5.08cm(2 inched) apart onto
            ungreased cookie sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and centers are
            soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Let sit briefly before transferring to wire
            racks to cool completely.
        </li>
    </ol>
