    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220 degrees C(425 degrees F).
            Grease two 30.48 cm(12 inches) pizza pans.
        </li>
        <li>Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano
            basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt and pepper in medium
            bowl until smooth. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in
            a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended,
            about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time,
            until a soft, sticky dough forms.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer doug to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and
            elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. Let dough rest
            covered, for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of
            of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.
        </li>
        <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven unti crusts are browned and the cheese is
            bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom
            oven racks halfway through baking.
        </li>
